# Numpy AI Kit

Numpy AI Kit is a complete artificial intelligence library built from scratch using pure Python and Numpy.

The current documentation for the project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/benjaminrall/numpy-ai-kit/wiki).

This README will be properly constructed when the project has a few more features to talk about.
